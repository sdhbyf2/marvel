Myself Sudheer Palakurla working on project: <strong>Marvel API Using React.js</strong>

<img src="src/logo.png" width="50%" alt="Marvel logo"/>

A simple web application which navigates to Marvel Characters Records. This application shows Name, Description, Image, List of Stories, Events and Series of the Characters

The application is developed using React.js and by Marvel API

At first we need to have node.js in our device to run the project. (Installation Details: https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs)

We need to create a new project for developing a single page react application.

#### `npx create-react-app marvel`

after installation enter into the directory

#### `cd marvel`

In Additional need to add more dependencies used for this project which are:
- Axios 
#### `npm install axios`

- React-router-dom 
#### `npm install react-router-dom`

- Blueimp-md5 
#### `npm install blueimp-md5`

- Material-UI/core - Installation Details: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material

#### `npm start` to run the project

Once the app runs the project in the development mode, open browser http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Here we have been used some third party design layouts for the User interface. This task user intefrface is basic but in future the designing can be much improved.
